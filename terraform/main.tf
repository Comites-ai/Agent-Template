# Agent Infrastructure — Terraform
#
# This file manages all GCP resources for the agent EXCEPT the GCP project
# itself and the terraform state bucket. Both are bootstrapped via gcloud
# in get_started_linux.sh (the project because terraform managing its own
# project is fragile; the state bucket because the backend has to exist
# before `terraform init`).
#
# STRUCTURE:
#   Section 1: Common infrastructure (all agents)
#   Section 2: Slack-specific infrastructure (uncomment if using Slack)
#   Section 3: Google Chat-specific infrastructure
#   Section 4: Telegram-specific infrastructure
#   Section 5: Discord-specific infrastructure
#   Section 6: Scheduler MCP key (uncomment to use The Forum's scheduler MCP)
#
# Sections 2-6 are commented out by default. get_started_linux.sh uncomments
# whichever ones the operator selects. You can also uncomment them manually.
#
# Hard rule: never add cloud resources to this agent outside terraform.
# Modify this file, `terraform apply`, and commit. See AGENTS.md.

# SECTION 1: COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE (Required for all agents)
# ==============================================================================

# The project is pre-existing — created via `gcloud projects create` in
# get_started_linux.sh. We reference it as a data source so we never own
# its lifecycle.

# bindings on this agent's platform secrets.

  # tokens for the per-agent SA at different phases of the engine lifecycle:
  #   - gcp-sa-aiplatform        — general AI Platform control plane
  #   - gcp-sa-aiplatform-re     — Reasoning Engine resource management
  #   - gcp-sa-aiplatform-cc     — runs the workload CONTAINER and emulates
  #                                the metadata server inside it. This is
  #                                the one whose missing binding manifests
  #                                as the cryptic "Compute Engine Metadata

  #                                at engine startup. The other two pass
  #                                preflight without it.
  # All three are auto-provisioned by `gcloud beta services identity create
  # --service=aiplatform.googleapis.com` (one call provisions all sub-agents),
  # which the bootstrap runs in phase 5.

# iam.googleapis.com, and terraform's own auto-enable on first SA
# creation isn't reliable for IAM-related ops).

# terraform — not in this repo, because the agent template shouldn't
# manage org policies on a project it doesn't own. See AGENTS.md rule #3
# for the exact snippet to give the Forum operator.
#
# Skipping either override (this one or the Forum-side one) produces the
# same failure: `adk deploy agent_engine` creates the Reasoning Engine
# cleanly, then every metadata-server token request at runtime returns
# 500 and the engine never serves a single user message.

# NOTE — the COMPANION Forum-side override is NOT in this repo.
# `iam.disableCrossProjectServiceAccountUsage` enforces on both sides of
# cross-project SA usage: this repo's `allow_cross_project_sa` resource (above)
# releases the agent's own project (the SA's home), but the Forum project also
# needs the same override to accept the external SA at attach time. That second
# override lives in the Forum's own terraform — see AGENTS.md rule #3 for the
# exact snippet to add there. We don't manage it from this repo because cross-
# project org-policy resources should be owned by whoever owns the project they
# target (the Forum operator), not by every agent that reaches into the Forum.
#
# If you're standing up the very first agent against a fresh Forum project and
# `adk deploy agent_engine` fails with the metadata-server 500 at runtime, the
# Forum-side override is the likely cause — ask the Forum operator to add it.

# --- Staging bucket for ADK deployments ---
# `adk deploy agent_engine` uploads the agent code here before deploying
# to Vertex AI. Lifecycle policy cleans up old uploads after 7 days.
#
# Note on project placement: the Reasoning Engine itself runs in the
# Forum's project (so all agents are administratively centralized), but
# the staging bucket lives in THIS project. That keeps the agent's code
# artifacts isolated under the agent's billing and IAM. The Forum's
# Vertex AI Service Agent gets read-only access via the cross-project
# IAM binding below (`engine_staging_reader`), so it can fetch the
# packaged agent code at cold-start time.

#
# The Reasoning Engine lands in the Forum's project but RUNS AS this
# agent's per-agent SA (configured via .agent_engine_config.json's
# `service_account` field). Three Vertex AI service agents in the Forum
# project participate at different phases of the engine lifecycle (see
# the `forum_vertex_ai_service_agents` local at the top of this file);
# each needs:
#
#   1. Permission to mint tokens for the per-agent SA
#      (`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on the SA itself).
#   2. Permission to read the packaged agent code from this staging
#      bucket (`roles/storage.objectViewer` on the bucket).
#
# The bindings below fan out to all three with a for_each. The most
# load-bearing one is the -cc agent (custom container runtime); if its
# binding is missing the engine deploys cleanly and then 500s on the
# first invocation with "Compute Engine Metadata server unavailable.
# Response status: 500" — a failure mode that the other two would pass

# --- Per-agent SA roles on the Forum project ---
#
# The Reasoning Engine runs in the Forum project AS the per-agent SA. For
# the engine to start and serve traffic, that SA needs baseline workload
# roles on the Forum project — without them, the runtime metadata server
# returns 500 on the first token request and the engine never reaches its
# first user message (no useful log line, just a hung first reply).
# These are the same roles the Forum's default compute SA has, which is
# why the old shared-SA setup "just worked" — the per-agent SA inherits
# nothing automatically when it moves to the Forum project.
#
# The local lives next to the resource (rather than with the other locals
# at the top of the file) because the set is specifically tied to this
# one binding — easier to maintain together when adding/removing roles.
#
# Operator IAM requirement: the user running `terraform apply` needs
# `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin` on the Forum project to grant
# these. If you don't, terraform fails here with a clear PERMISSION_DENIED
# — ask the Forum's admin to grant the bindings manually with:
#   for role in roles/aiplatform.user roles/logging.logWriter \

# SECTION 5: DISCORD

#   1. Uncomment this section, `terraform apply`.
#   2. Populate ${bot_account_id}-discord-token with the bot token.
#   3. register_agent.py writes the Firestore platform block on next deploy.
#   4. Wait up to 300s (or reset the worker VM in The Forum's project) for
#      the worker to pick up the new bot.
# No terraform changes in The Forum's repo are required.
#
# Discord needs TWO cross-project secretAccessor bindings: the discord-worker
# VM SA (reads the token to open the inbound Gateway WebSocket) AND The Forum's
# Cloud Run SA (reads the token to send outbound REST replies). Granting only
# one results in DMs reaching The Forum but every reply 403ing.
